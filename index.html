  <h1> Drawing in My Life
          By: Abby Robinson
  </h1>          
  <p1>Drawing is one of the many hobbies that I have enjoyed all my life. My artistic talent came from both my parents. My mother is artistically gifted, and my father is musically gifted. I have been drawing since I was a baby, but I never took it seriously until I was a junior in highschool and i finally took a legitimate art class.
